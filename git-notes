Notes
===================

Currently, remotes are 'gwdg', which is local, or "origin", which is the github repo. The path for gwdg is the local path to gwdg '/media/nano/fmoyano/SoilModel/R.git'
A pull from gwdg will only work when in /media/nano/fmoyano/SoilModel/R.git.


===================
Remote repositories 
===================

# Add a remote repository 
git remote add nameofremoterepo path/to/remoterepo

# Remove remote repository
git remote remove nameofremoterepo

# Rename remote repo
git remote rename oldname newname

# Change URL of a remote
git remote set-url origin <url>


===================
Branches 
===================

# Deleting a local branch
git branch -D <branchName>

# Deleting a remote branch:
git push origin --delete <branchName>

# Add branch to remote and track:
git push -u origin <branchName>

# Add all branches to remote and track (this activaes the Rstudio push/pull buttons):
git push --all -u origin

# Add all new branches and update everything to remote
git push --mirror origin

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branchName>

# Track all remote branches
for remote in `git branch -r | grep -v /HEAD`; do git checkout --track $remote ; done

# Remove deleted files that cannot be committed. (Don't know why)
git add -u
(#alternative: git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs)


===================
Files
===================
# remove local (untracked) files
git clean -f -n  # just to see what would be removed
git clean -f     # this actually deletes the files


===================
Other stuff
===================

# Merging single files (merge file f from branch B into branch A)
git checkout A
git checkout --patch B f

# Merging specific commits
